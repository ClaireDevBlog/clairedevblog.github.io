I used some pieces of clothes to create the prototype for the live coding vest. All the markers are stick to the vest with double-sided tape. Below are what the vest looks like:

A simple AR application was created to test the feasiblity of tracking markers on the vest. In the current application, planes with different color are displayed super-impose the markers on the vest.
